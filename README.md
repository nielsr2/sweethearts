# sweethearts
this mini project is the processing interpretation of selected poems from emmett williams’ book “sweethearts”.

the poet provides the following explanation in his book:
“the structural and textural characteristics of this erotic poem cycle derive from the 11 letters of the word sweethearts.
unluckily for the poet 3 of these 11 letters are es and 2 others occur twice so that there are only 7 different ones for word building.
from these letters are extracted all the words that make the poem.
the position of each letter on the page is determined by its place in the word sweethearts.
no single poem can be more than 11 letters wide or 11 letters deep.
in addition to the word poems there are kinetic metaphors also constructed from the 11 letters of sweethearts.”
emmett williams 1966
